## Hello, welcome to the summary of my solution. 👋
I'll discuss a few things (won't be getting into scholarly details 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫)

- How I've been spending my time these days
- Concise (English descriptive) answers to each question
- Final comments on the task

## Time
In the past two weeks (one month actually), I've gone through a whirlwind of networking and interviewing for a mixture of roles.

I've never really been committed fully to working with recruiting agencies and going after their tips and I've been asked to dig deep in areas which I've only superficially covered (on average 2-3 times a week).

I've worked through 3 assignments similar to this one (completely different areas: NLP, deep learning, and a combination of data engineering, web development + ML engineering) which were allocated a longer time (so more work)...

I am definitely looking to get into the competitive engineering space, and first is to get in the pace of creation/look at opportunities to contribute (So, I really did enjoy putting time into this assignment; wish I'd work on it more fully).

Unfortunately, I've been mostly a hands-off high level manager for the past year (with the exception of a few projects: ~6, week long or day long projects).

## Summaries

Data Analysis:

>*I gave in to the bias according to my previous work experience and I took the "elegant" approach of signal decomposition. I didn't complete the work, but committed just enough to show that I can repeat the same process to all the data instead of just parts. The data wrangling is complete, the plotting is not.*

Price Estimation:

>*The ultimate ideal would be to go through surrogate models, i.e. apply actual theoretically, econometrically and scientifically backed pricing "strategies" to recreate those state-of-the-art models for housing price (and sales) estimation. With machine learning, several of these patterns can be picked up; should any changes happen however, the models won't change the same ways that theories (and their applications) govern.*

Geospatial Comprehension:

>*I think you might be looking at bi-directional A\* search?*

## Final comments
This is a great synthetic data set! I really enjoyed working with it and being able to make changes according to every possible consideration (for how to deal with missing data).

For the fancier processing (in a real life application), I would look at manifold learning to "recover" the missing data.

Also, I would look at evolutionary survival of the best performing model and ensemble techniques for "continual" machine-learning based price estimation.

* **Immediate work** to do additionally perhaps is geographical plotting of the data, and visualization techniques.
* I really wanted to look at the **recommended libraries** and work with graphical data. It's one of the things I like to do.
